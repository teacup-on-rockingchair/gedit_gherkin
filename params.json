{"name":"Gedit gherkin","body":"The repository contains 4 files needed for your gEdit to hihglight Gherkin language, used by cucumber to describe features.\r\n\r\nThe feature.xml and gherkin.lang are needed for you to install on any platform that you can use gedit. \r\n\r\nI will describe here each of the files and the installation procedure I followed for my Ubuntu system.\r\nGuess it would be pretty much the same for any other Unix-based one, or even any system that u can run gEdit\r\n\r\n   \tREADME  - this file\r\n \tcukelang_generate_gherkin.rb \tRuby script run on the shell generates as an output the gherkin.lang file\r\n \tfeature.xml \t             \tXML that is used to describe the *.feature file in which the Gherkin language is used\r\n \tgherkin.lang                    The specification of Gherkin based on what cucumber 0.8.5 output, in all languages it supports\r\n\r\nTo make use of the syntax highlight of Gherkin you need to:\r\n -  copy the feature.xml file to ~/.local/share/mime/packages or /usr/share/mime/packages\r\n -  run 'sudo update-mime-database  ~/.local/share/mime' or 'sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime'\r\n -  copy the gherkin.lang file to ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/gherkin.lang or \r\n    /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/\r\n\r\n To generate new lang file you need to have ruby and cucumber installed and run the script:\r\n\r\n'ruby  cukelang_generate_gherkin.rb > ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/gherkin.lang'\r\n\r\nAfter that you should see your feature files to look like that:\r\n![screenshot](https://github.com/strandjata/gedit_gherkin/raw/master/screengherkin.png)\r\n\r\nNote: I have tested only with Left-to-right Languages, since I do not know Arabic or Hebrew I will be no use testing it.\r\n     So anyone who has notes/comments/fixes on that can contribute\r\n","tagline":"Cucumber's Gherkin syntax for the gEdit text editor and any other gtksourceview based on","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
