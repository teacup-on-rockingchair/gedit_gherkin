This is small description of the files I added in the repository

The repository contains 4 files needed for your gEdit to hihglight Gherkin language, used by cucumber to describe features.

The feature.xml and gherkin.lang are needed for you to install on any platform that you can use gedit. 

I will describe here each of the files and the installation procedure I followed for my Ubuntu system.
Guess it would be pretty much the same for any other Unix-based one, or even any system that u can run gEdit

   	README  - this file
 	cukelang_generate_gherkin.rb 	Ruby script run on the shell generates as an output the gherkin.lang file
 	feature.xml 	             	XML that is used to describe the *.feature file in which the Gherkin language is used
 	gherkin.lang                    The specification of Gherkin based on what cucumber 0.8.5 output, in all languages it supports

To make use of the syntax highlight of Gherkin you need to:
 -  copy the feature.xml file to ~/.local/share/mime/packages or /usr/share/mime/packages
 -  run 'sudo update-mime-database  ~/.local/share/mime' or 'sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime'
 -  copy the gherkin.lang file to ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/gherkin.lang or 
    /usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/

 To generate new lang file you need to have ruby and cucumber installed and run the script:

'ruby  cukelang_generate_gherkin.rb > ~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/gherkin.lang'

Note: I have tested only with Left-to-right Languages, since I do not know Arabic or Hebrew I will be no use testing it.
     So anyone who has notes/comments/fixes on that can contribute
